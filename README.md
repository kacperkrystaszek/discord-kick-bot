# discord-kick-bot
discord bot that kicks deafened, muted or afk users and creates rank

bot reacts to events like deafening, muting or being afk. timer is set to 15 minutes, after that it kicks out user from server. there is set a command &rank which shows up ranking of ever kicked users. the & prefix can be changed in file. 

check file discordbot.py and where it's said, write your settings. 

it works with amazon s3 and uses it as a cloud. i used it on heroku so i recommend to make it too.
